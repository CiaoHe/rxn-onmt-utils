# rxn_onmt_utils

[![Build Status](https://travis.ibm.com/rxn/rxn_onmt_utils.svg?token=zJxfB9t9kgVLYHLdp5pG&branch=develop)](https://travis.ibm.com/rxn/rxn_onmt_utils)

Utilities related to the use of OpenNMT.

The repository contains both (i) ONMT-related code that is independent of the RXN models, as well as (ii) code specific to chemistry tasks.
The files for (ii) are mainly located under the `rxn_models` directory. Some of this is independent of OpenNMT and may be moved elsewhere at a later stage.
